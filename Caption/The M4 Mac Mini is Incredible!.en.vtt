00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.898
(box clunks)

00:00:02.898 --> 00:00:05.050
(tape tearing)

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.217
(chilled lo-fi music)

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:13.874
(wrap rustling)

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:23.945
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.780
- So usually, one crazy thing
about a new piece of tech

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.950
is enough to get my attention,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.920
just something out of
the ordinary about it.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.170
But this new Mac mini

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.410
has three things about it that are insane.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.970
So instead of having an event this year,

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.460
Apple decided to do a bunch
of press releases in a row

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.660
for the last week of October

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.390
to update their whole Mac lineup to M4.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.640
And one of them was for this new Mac mini.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.860
Now, a lot of us might not give

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.270
too much thought to the Mac mini,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.950
like, yeah, maybe it
holds an important place

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.330
as the most affordable Mac,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.560
but if you're not buying one,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.240
you're not really thinking
about it too much.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.950
But the number one most insane
thing about this refresh is,

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.140
well, I mean look at it, it's tiny.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.630
It is absolutely tiny.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.610
Apple's gone through and redesigned

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.080
basically all of their computers now

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.060
that have gotten the Mac silicon update.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.930
Well, except this one,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.180
this is the same design as a while ago,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.370
but the Mac mini was kind of technically

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.080
overdue for a redesign.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.120
And the new one, it actually
kinda looks a little bit more

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.660
like a shrunken Mac Studio
than a shrunken old Mac mini.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.340
But it's now a five inch
by five inch footprint

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.570
and two inches tall.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.570
I'll say that again, a five by
five by two desktop computer.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.710
Now I like small desktops,

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.170
and yes, you could get a
tiny desktop computer before,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.510
there's plenty of amazing
mini ITX build videos

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.520
all over the internet that
I've watched for years.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.420
They're sick.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.380
But there's levels to this,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.130
there's small computers and
then there's tiny computers.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.850
And this Mac mini is smaller
than my R5 with a lens on it.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.400
It's smaller than a new roll of duct tape.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.980
It's smaller than the
footprint of the new iPhone

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.510
and barely bigger than the
absolutely tiny Apple TV.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.820
Apple's seemingly had this obsession

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.090
with making certain computers
as small as possible,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.830
even before Apple silicon came along.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.230
So this has just kind of
unlocked another level for them

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.030
to push it even further than ever before.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.800
Yeah, there are fans in here,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.750
but there are also ports on the back.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.170
Gigabit ethernet by default,
full size HDMI is still here.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.970
And then three Thunderbolt
ports on the back

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.630
and then there's two
USB-C 3 ports on the front

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.830
plus the headphone jack.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.480
So still no SD card reader.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.180
And there's obviously now no more USB-A.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.580
If you tried to build

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.510
or buy another computer
to match this thing,

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.100
you will either end up building a computer

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.640
that's just as small but
nowhere near as capable,

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.160
or a computer that's just as capable,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.660
but nowhere near as small.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.313
It is just a hilariously
unnecessarily tiny computer.

00:02:56.313 --> 00:02:57.153
It's great.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.180
I would also like to start
a new conspiracy theory.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.190
I would like to use this video
to start a conspiracy theory.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.580
I think that there is someone
whose job it is at Apple,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.500
someone whose sole purpose
(sinister mysterious music)

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.500
is to come up with one obnoxious
thing to complain about

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.120
for every new Apple product redesign.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.360
Like this is the person that
put the notch on the iPhone.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.460
This is the person that
put the charge port

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.440
at the bottom of the Magic Mouse.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.100
And this person's best work is right here

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.720
on this new Mac mini,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.140
putting the power button
on the bottom of it.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.460
Like, why?

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.270
There are so many better
places to put a power button,

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.550
like at the front or the side,

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.080
or literally anywhere on the back,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.330
like all the other small Mac desktops.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.370
Or at the top. That
would've been fine too.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.613
But no, they chose behind the back corner,

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.550
which is (sighs) just...

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.740
I mean, I don't use
that button very often.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.020
I don't really turn the Mac on

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.120
and off with a button almost ever.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.040
I might sleep it and wake it back up,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.450
and maybe every couple of weeks,

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.460
I'll have to remember that
the button's back there.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.460
But yeah, it's just dumb
enough to get memed on

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.120
and complained about without
actually being an issue.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.170
Well played, guy.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.150
But yeah, you know, the
typical consequences

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.890
of a computer getting smaller

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.340
are battery, speakers, and thermals.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.170
There's just less room
inside for those things.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.340
Battery of course doesn't make a huge

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.230
difference on a desktop, who cares?

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.930
Speakers, kind of the
same thing, who cares?

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.720
And thermals have been redesigned in a way

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.520
that seem to be working just fine.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.170
This thing hardly gets over a peep.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.290
If you do heavy stuff,
the single fan spins up

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.330
and you can hear it, but
it's always been quiet,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.160
sitting on the desk,
you can hardly hear it.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.550
So then the number two insane
thing about the new Mac mini

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.410
is that the base model is kind
of an incredible deal now.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.000
No, like I don't think you understand it.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.480
I think it's actually one
of the best deals in tech.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.860
It's certainly the best out of any

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.960
of Apple's new product
offerings right now.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.050
And I mean, I'm kind of
not used to saying it,

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.430
but it is a really good deal.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.300
So this base M4 Mac mini costs 599, right?

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.150
So for that, you get the base
computer with the M4 chip,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.870
which has quietly doubled
to 16 gigs of unified memory

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.580
instead of eight from before.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.160
So the 10 core CPU and the 10 core GPU.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.310
Now we're four generations
into Apple silicon

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.520
and the gains are
actually kind of starting

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.920
to stack up versus M1.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.270
We already know it was a huge difference

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.910
from the Intel chips, but I
actually wanna get a little bit

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:31.440
more into that in the MacBook Pro review

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.960
because I've been using
an M1 Max MacBook Pro

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.000
for three years since it came out.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.820
And the M4 Max is the first one

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.860
that's actually tempted me to upgrade

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.050
between generations of Apple silicon.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.883
It's really interesting.

00:05:43.883 --> 00:05:46.380
So get subscribed and
stay tuned for that video

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.520
when it comes out.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.050
But the main thing you need to know is

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.420
this base M4 chip is great,

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.460
it's super solid and power efficient

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.770
at everyday normal
activities like web browsing

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.560
and music streaming and
multitasking like crazy.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.960
And it can handle what
I think I would call

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:03.690
medium-grade activities very easily.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.380
Not heavy stuff like
graphically-intensive gaming

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.060
or a heavy video editing,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.010
but pretty much anything short of that.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.140
This could be a coding
and developing machine,

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.180
this could be a photo editing machine.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.220
Pixelmator runs like a dream.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:21.090
And fun fact, Apple just bought
Pixelmator, interestingly.

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.890
But yeah, just having
a ton of Arc tabs open,

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.170
stuff like that, like just
running around, multitasking,

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.670
it runs like a dream, it's great.

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:28.260
It's as good as you'd expect

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.620
the world's fastest single
core performer to do.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.840
So yeah, Mac mini, you know,
four years, like I said,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.270
it has been the most affordable Mac,

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.240
the sort of entry point for
anyone to get into Mac OS.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.120
But this year with the
doubling of the base memory,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.690
it just feels like a
particularly good deal.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.160
Think of it this way,

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.320
the M4 iMac that also just got refreshed

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.210
is basically the exact same computer,

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.730
but just in an upright desktop

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:55.770
with a non replaceable display.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.970
That starts at $1,299.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:01.740
So you can use that $700 difference

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.230
to kind of get whatever screen you want.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:09.000
Now, you can obviously also
upgrade from the base Mac mini,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.800
but I don't think you
should, and I'll explain why.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.660
See, Apple is known for building

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.730
what I've called a price ladder,

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:15.630
and they're just trying to get you

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.070
to climb as high as possible.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.390
They do this across all their products,

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:20.790
but there's basically always
a really tempting upgrade

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.670
sitting right above the base model.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.080
And then when you spend that money,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.870
you're kind of right underneath
another tempting upgrade,

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:29.640
and then they kind of walk you up,

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.620
trying to get you to spend
as much money as possible.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.877
It's really smart, they do it with iPhones

00:07:32.877 --> 00:07:34.860
and with iPads and with everything else.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.200
This base Mac mini, I'm
telling you is a good deal,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.000
but it only has 256 gigs of storage.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.470
And many people are fine with that

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.140
and they can live with that, that's great.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.540
But if you know you're gonna
be working with a lot of media,

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.670
a lot of video,

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.310
then you start looking at
upgrades to the storage,

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:55.230
and that's where you'll
find that walking it up

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:00.230
to a terabyte costs 400 more dollars.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.640
Or if you plan to do
some wired networking,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.440
bumping it up to 10 gig ethernet costs

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.660
100 more dollars on top of that.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:08.160
for the price of just those upgrades,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.650
you could almost get an
entire nother MAC mini.

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:11.483
It's crazy.

00:08:11.483 --> 00:08:12.930
Like basically, across the board,

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.990
Apple's upgrade pricing is
pretty crazy with this computer,

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.550
which is why I'm specifically saying

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.530
the base model is such a good deal.

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.520
And actually if you're lucky enough

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.710
to have a .edu email address right now,

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.880
the student discount drops it
down to 499, which is sick.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.770
But once you know you're
gonna be doing upgrades

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.420
to the pre-purchase spec,

00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.160
which you have to know before buying it,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.870
'cause you can't upgrade
it after the fact,

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:36.300
all the memory, everything is built in,

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.030
then it becomes more of a normal deal.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:39.863
I do wanna say this though.

00:08:39.863 --> 00:08:42.870
So the third and final crazy
thing about this Mac Mini

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:46.500
is that the maxed out version has a case

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.920
for the best portable workstation Mac.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.810
Now this doesn't apply to everybody.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.010
This is coming from me,

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:56.340
someone who used to drag an
iMac Pro in a Pelican case

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.170
through the airport to events

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.150
because it was the fastest editing machine

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.500
that I could reasonably travel with,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.060
and it actually made sense for me.

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.760
So coming from that perspective,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.430
this new Mac mini is sick.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.800
So looking at the Mac Studios,

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.390
those aren't upgraded to M4 yet,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.430
they've all got the M2 generation.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.800
And it's also not gonna be the Mac Pro,

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.960
which is also still on the M2 generation

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.430
and obviously not portable.

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.440
The iMac is on M4,

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.990
but there's no Pro chips, so
it's just the base M4 chip.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.420
So this Mac mini is the easiest way

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.820
to pack an M4 Pro chip with you

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.640
and just throw it in a
travel bag super easily.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.850
An equivalent spec'd
MacBook Pro with M4 Pro

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.920
starts at $2,000,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.050
which is actually another
decently good deal

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.890
as far as performance.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.320
But if you don't need a laptop
or if you just wanna plug

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.110
and play into monitors wherever you go,

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.080
1399 gets you the M4 Pro Mac mini.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.990
And that upgrade also gets
you the back Thunderbolt ports

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.150
being Thunderbolt 5
instead of Thunderbolt 4.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:57.180
So it can support three 6K
displays instead of two.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.510
So I've had and been
testing the M4 Pro here

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:02.220
with 48 gigs of memory,

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.400
and fun fact, if you run through
some synthetic benchmarks,

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.350
this runs up the highest CPU
score of any desktop Mac ever.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:11.970
That includes the Mac Pro

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.130
and the Mac Studios and all of them.

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:16.620
This is by far the most
powerful single core

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.540
we've ever seen by a lot.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.770
And then Multi-Core just barely

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.960
tops Geekbench's all time Mac list,

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.570
though as we know, CPU doesn't
really bump up all that much

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:28.170
when you go from base
to Pro to Max to Ultra,

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.670
it's way more GPU stuff.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.590
And so when you look at GPU benchmarks,

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.050
the most powerful Mac
mini here with the M4 Pro,

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.300
it was putting up M1 Max numbers,

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.120
which again, shows how much
these generations over time

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.850
have been improving and
stacking on top of each other.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.420
I've been editing videos
on an M1 Max laptop

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.340
for three years now on the MacBook Pro.

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.360
So this Mac mini feels like

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.170
one of those impossibly small computers

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.480
Apple's like always
kind of wanted to make,

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.650
even before Apple silicon.

00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:58.380
Like you probably remember
some of their earlier attempts,

00:10:58.380 --> 00:10:59.940
like the "Trashcan" MAC Pro,

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.590
no doubt, they wanted do something crazy.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.650
They wanted to put a
workstation-class computer on the desk

00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.150
cooled by a single fan.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:08.250
We saw how that went with
the Intel chip inside,

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.980
or even some of those
razor thin i9 MacBook Pros

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.690
that started having overheating issues.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.690
But now that Apple silicon
has gotten this good

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.830
and this efficient over time,

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.700
they're actually able to
make tiny, powerful computers

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.660
like the Mac Studio

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.120
and now like this little
Mac mini over here.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.513
Nobody was asking for the
Mac mini to be even smaller,

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:31.230
except for those people
in the Spaceship Campus

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:32.463
somewhere in California.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.373
Well played.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.840
Well played.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.310
Thanks for watching.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.947
Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
The programmer.

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,600
An offshoot of the Great 8 family closely related to chimpsing gorillas, distinguished by

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,679
its minimal bipedal movement and ability to stare at a computer screen for the majority

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,679
of its lifetime.

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:14,160
There's an estimated 30 million specimens alive in the world today.

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,240
Normal humans use stereotypes to help understand and generalize this unusual variant, which experts

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,839
estimate are about 99% accurate, about 12% of the time.

8
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:26,640
In today's video, we'll take a look at 10 different programmer stereotypes to find out

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,080
which one you fall into.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,600
First up, we have the gear head.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,560
This variant owns the bleeding edge version of everything, like the latest M1 Mac, a big

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,799
ass curved monitor, mechanical keyboard, Tesla in the garage, AI generated synthetic

13
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:40,840
meat in the fridge, and a smart lock on the house to keep it all safe.

14
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,240
When programming, he goes wherever the hype train takes him.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,760
In 96, it was Java, in 06, it was JQuery, and 2016 it was GraphQL, and in 2026, he'll

16
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,600
be first in line at NURL-Link to get a chip that can help him right blazingly fast-code.

17
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:56,040
It doesn't matter what the tech does, if it's trendy, it belongs in the stack.

18
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,879
This stereotype may be true sometimes, but programming can actually push many people in

19
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,039
the opposite direction.

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,739
The guy who works in tech, but hates tech stereotype, knows exactly how unreliable and dangerous

21
00:01:05,739 --> 00:01:06,739
code can be.

22
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:10,439
Like that the RAC-25 incident, where a little software bug accidentally killed some people

23
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,920
by giving them a massive overdose of radiation.

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,480
This guy would never buy a car that can be remotely summoned back to Elon when you stop

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
paying the bill.

26
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,900
Antihua definitely never put a smart lock on his house, because the NSA probably has

27
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:24,840
backed or accessed, or at the very least there's an undiscovered exploit in its code.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,240
If you broke into his farmhouse, you'd find a single monitor Linux machine, a flip

29
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,960
phone, some gold bullion, and a shotgun barrel pointed in your face.

30
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,200
The most stereotypical programmer though, has to be the introvert.

31
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,320
He's a savant who still sleeps in a car bed, and his vision of the ideal lifestyle is what

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,120
the rest of society calls quarantine.

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,659
He's super good at math, and can actually program stuff without using Google and Stack

34
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:47,760
Overflow, but couldn't hold a conversation to save his life.

35
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,359
Extroverts like jobs use these nerds like Waz to get super rich.

36
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:56,319
The stereotype used to be 100% true back when programming was hard, like pre-1990s.

37
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,920
But as programming has become more mainstream, it's led to a new paradigm.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:00,920
The programmer.

39
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,120
This guy got a computer science degree while mostly partying with his frat and college.

40
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,840
His name is usually Chad, and he has more mating opportunities than the introvert, but

41
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,960
it comes at a cost of reduced code quality, which he refuses to test, because test-driven

42
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,560
development is for losers.

43
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Not real.

44
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,840
However, he has better communication skills than the introverts, which is annoying because

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,560
I wish this guy would stop talking to me.

46
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,759
Eventually, he evolves into your manager, where he can torment you with code reviews

47
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,400
and team building exercises.

48
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,599
Now so far in this video, I've been using a lot of masculine pronouns.

49
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,120
That's because 95% of my audience is male, which is actually pretty close to the real

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
world distribution today.

51
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,879
What you may not realize though, is that back in the day, women used to dominate the

52
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:37,879
programming space.

53
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:41,920
Kathleen Booth created the first assembly language, Grace Hopper created the first compiler,

54
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,400
and Margaret Hamilton led the team who wrote the code for the Apollo moonlander.

55
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,199
Code that was so flawless and perfectly executed that some people think it's proof we didn't

56
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:50,199
actually go to the moon.

57
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:53,599
That was the apex of code quality, since that time everything's gone downhill.

58
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,079
The next specimen we'll look at is the influencer or code-fluencer.

59
00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:01,199
His natural habitat is not a code editor, but rather a social media platform most commonly

60
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,199
Twitter.

61
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:05,799
After figuring out how to print hello world in PHP, he immediately rose to the top of

62
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,919
the dominance hierarchy in his own mind.

63
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,199
Now he makes the world a better place by regurgitating code tips and hot takes all day long,

64
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:15,359
and he just landed a better paying job than you, because he mastered the art of virtue

65
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:16,359
signaling.

66
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,639
And that's what we call a good culture fit.

67
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:20,079
Another popular stereotype is the hacker.

68
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,080
This guy's able to open up a terminal, connect to some remote mainframe, and break all of

69
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,400
its security protocols one by one, with awesome fancy animations between each step.

70
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,480
This stereotype is what most people think programmers do, but is 100% manufactured by Hollywood.

71
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,080
Real hacking is extremely tedious and boring, and is done primarily by the people who have

72
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,080
all the guns.

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,439
Now a stereotype that is actually real is the 10x developer.

74
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:45,960
This guy is an extremely rare unicorn that can do the work of 10 other developers combined.

75
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,360
Some say they're a myth, but I've seen developers first hand who write code like

76
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,400
to Rampplace Basketball, or Casperov Place Chess.

77
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,160
There are people out there with a natural problem solving ability that just goes far beyond

78
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,480
the rest of the population.

79
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,840
You'll know a 10x developer when you see one, because you'll feel very incompetent and

80
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,000
also very jealous.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,200
Now I think the ideal stereotype for most of us to fall into is the lazy programmer.

82
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,760
To the outside world, it doesn't look like this guy does much.

83
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,040
He sits at a computer all day hitting the keyboard, and if you glance at a screen, it

84
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,560
looks like he's just copying and pasting things from the internet.

85
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,960
What he's actually doing though is building a million dollar side hustle, so he can retire

86
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
in his 30s.

87
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,159
He also has a remote job with a 400k salary, but he eats ramen for dinner while sharing

88
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,039
a crappy apartment with four other dudes.

89
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:29,799
His wardrobe is 50% swag from tech conferences, and 50% things is mom-bottom.

90
00:04:29,799 --> 00:04:32,439
He leverages code to work smarter and not harder.

91
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,479
Now on the other end of the spectrum, we have the old jaded guy.

92
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:37,799
He has long silver hair and a big white beard.

93
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:42,240
He only codes in C, not C++, and definitely not any of the hipster garbage that you're

94
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
using.

95
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,079
In fact, he probably wrote the compiler for the silly toy language that you were trying

96
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,079
to learn.

97
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,919
The knowledge transcends the normal apes idea of reality when he discovered through psychedelics

98
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:54,680
that were all just one entity that found a hack in the universe to experience itself in

99
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,120
parallel with primate bodies, and computers are the tool that will ultimately make us

100
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
one again.

101
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,959
And that concludes our presentation on programmer stereotypes.

102
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,199
Let me know which one you fall into in the comments below.

103
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,599
Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next one.

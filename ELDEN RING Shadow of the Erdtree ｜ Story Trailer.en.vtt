00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:17.300
Miquella the Kind spoke of the beginning.

00:00:20.516 --> 00:00:24.216
The seduction. And the betrayal.

00:00:31.916 --> 00:00:34.916
An affair from which Gold arose.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.550
And so too was Shadow born.

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:52.150
What followed was a war unseen.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.250
One that could never be put to song.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:10.383
A purge without Grace or honour.

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:16.666
The tyranny of Messmer's flame.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.083
And so Kindly Miquella would abandon everything.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.400
His golden flesh, his blinding strength.

00:02:13.916 --> 00:02:15.766
Even his fate.

00:02:20.483 --> 00:02:22.800
But we are not deterred.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.433
We choose to follow.

00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:38.500
Will you walk with us?
